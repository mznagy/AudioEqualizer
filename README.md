# Assignment Procedure:


## Inputs to program:


User should input the following:


1) The wave file name.


2) Gain of each of the frequency bands in db.


3) Type of filters used (FIR-IIR)


4) Output sample rate.


You may make use of the following functions: input – menu – uigetfile.


## Method:


1) Develop the frequency band filters in the following bands
( 0- 170 Hz) - ( 170- 300 Hz) - ( 300- 610 Hz) -( 610- 1005 Hz) -( 1005hz- 3 KHz) - ( 3- 6 KHz) - ( 6-
12 KHz) - ( 12-14 KHz) - ( 14-20 KHz)


2) Analyze and export these files (Gain, phase, impulse and step response, order and poles/zeros).


3) Filter the wave file using the filters developed in step 1.


4) Draw the output signals in Time and frequency domains.



5) Amplify the output signals using the user defined gain.


6) Add the amplified - output signals in time domain to form composite signal.


7) Draw and compare the composite signal with the original signal. (in time and frequency)


8) Play and save the output wave signal. (you can use wavwrite-sound)




# Outputs/Requirements of project:


## You should submit ONE PDF file contains the followings:


1) Copy of your code.


2) Different sample runs of code including the following cases:


a) If design is using FIR filters.


b) If design is using IIR filters.


c) Output signal in case if doubling output sample rate or decreasing it to half


3) The analysis of each filter and the exported outputs.


4) All figures of signals in time and frequency domain.


User interface to input the data to M- file even if as command window lines (GUI).
